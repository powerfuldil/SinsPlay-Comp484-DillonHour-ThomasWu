Sinsplay.us

Description: 

Sinsplay.us is a gaming website that allows users/players to get online and talk within a community. Additionally, users can come on
and download games created by this company. We wanted to make a website that allows for players to communicate with each other because 
most gaming websites do not have a chat or forums page. THerefore, users are able to ask for help with the game and they can work as 
a team to beat the game. Our intentions are to create a nice and simple landing page where its is very basic and simple to read. Then, 
we are going ot make a simple login/registration page for users to create an account. Additionally, we are going to have a forum page 
were users can communicate with each other. Last, we will implement a games page where the users can download games that this company
has created. THe best part of all this, is that it is all free to use. 

There is a merchandise page, but that is not for this class. In the future, we are planning to impelement a shop page for our gaming
company. That page is just added there for future reference once we do finish the website.
